written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt-A five-minute stroll from Syntagma down Avenue Amalias (or through the National Gardens) brings you to another ancient site. At the confluence of Avenues Amalias, Syngrou, and Vas. Olgas is Hadrian’s Gate built as a triumphal arch in a.d. 131 to mark the divide between the ancient city and his “new Athens.” To the east of the gate is the Olympieion, site of the largest temple ever built on Greek soil.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt:The Temple of Olympian Zeus is dedicated to Zeus, “king” of the Greek gods. It was imperative that his temple should be fitting for his position, and its dimensions — 250 m (814 ft) long and 130 m (426 ft) wide, with columns of over 17 m (61 ft) in height — are truly majestic. The temple took 700 years to complete and it was Hadrian who finished the task in the second century a.d. One hundred and eight columns originally surrounded an inner sanctum that protected a gold-and-ivory statue of Zeus. Today only 15 are still standing, but their Corinthian capitals have a wonderful form and elegance. In ancient times, the temple sat close to the banks of the River Ilissos creating an even more beautiful vista. Today the river still flows, but its path lies beneath the city.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt-Nearby, along Vas. Olgas, is the impressive Olympic Stadium, sitting in the lea of Ardittou Hill. The stadium was constructed for the ancient Panathanaic Games when each of the surrounding city-states sent delegations to compete. During Roman times beast-baiting also took place here. Dating from the third century b.c., the complex was refurbished for the games of a.d. 144 but was disused and left to decay after the fall of the empire. When the modern Olympic Games were convened in 1896, the stadium was refurbished as the flagship arena, and today it stands as a symbol of the global athletic movement. Witness the heroic statues that stand in the entranceway. Athens will once again host the games in 2004, but the central athletic complex will be at Kifissia — a northern suburb linked to the downtown area by bus and Metro.

Outside, water slides, nature trails, and swimming pools indicate that no expense has been spared to create the ultimate playground for all age groups. Many visitors to the Bahamas drop in just to marvel at the artistry and technical skill that was employed to create this complex. Non-guests must pay a fee to enjoy the resort facilities and an extra fee for a visit to the Dig.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:At the eastern end of Paradise Island stands a much older structure that offers the opportunity for restful contemplation. The Cloisters are the remains of a 14th-century monastery that was bought in France by Huntingdon Hartford, taken apart, and rebuilt in the grounds of his home, now the Ocean Club hotel. Hartford set the small courtyard on a rise several hundred yards away from the house and created an elaborate garden to lead to the edifice. The Versailles Gardens, based on Louis XIV’s formal palace gardens outside Paris, have terraces, fountains, and statues that provide a soothing vista, leading the eye from the house to the cloisters. It is possible to visit the Cloisters during daylight hours — they stand next to the only road that traverses the island — but they are used regularly for wedding ceremonies, so you might find them closed.

One bridge carries traffic on to the island, the other takes traffic back to Nassau (there is a small toll for vehicles). At the foot of the bridges is a small quay where you can catch a ferry to Woodes Rogers Walk in Nassau port. This is also the docking point for boats to Blue Lagoon and the Dolphin Experience. A small cay just a 20-minute boat ride from Paradise Island, Blue Lagoon is the site of a facility where you can swim with the dolphins or help the staff look after the animals for a day. Boats leave several times a day.

There are marvelous views looking directly down onto this compact little town of 6,000 inhabitants, set on a small peninsula with the waves crashing all around. The peninsula is actually formed from the volcanic debris that was deposited following a disastrous eruption in 1706, when most of the town and its inhabitants were destroyed. The best place to survey the aftermath of the petrified lava is from the beautifully preserved 16th-century Castillo de San Miguel. A lucky survivor, this fortress (note the heraldic arms above the doorway), is now devoted to handicraft sales. There is no beach to speak of here, but a very cleverly designed set of pools built into the rocks more than compensates. Despite the destruction, Garachico is a little gem. Neat houses boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled streets, and old churches adorn pretty squares. Unmissable, also, is the large, uninhabited rock out in the bay, and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of Garachico. Without a patron saint of its own, the town has elevated the rock to be its saint!
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:Farther along the coast road, 8 km (5 miles) past Buenavista del Norte, lies the most westerly point on Tenerife, the Punta de Teno. From here there are panoramic views across to La Gomera and looking south to the massive cliffs of Los Gigantes. Turn back to Buenavista and take a marked turn inland to Masca. Be warned, though, this is absolutely not a drive to be undertaken by inexperienced or nervous drivers. Initially the road, although ascending through the arable mountainside, is no problem; but this soon changes once the entrance to the vertiginous valley is reached. One glance at the narrow, steeply twisting road on either side will be enough to realize why, up to only a few years ago, the picturesque tiny village of Masca could only be reached on the back of a donkey. All around is some of the most dramatic scenery on the island. However, if you are driving, you won’t have any time to savor it. The road clings precariously to the side of lush, green mountains cleft by deep, dark ravines and often zig-zags on itself in the tightest of hairpin bends. And it is far from unknown to have to reverse back down and around these bends, allowing other vehicles to pass. A stop at Masca is not just a pleasure, but also a relief. Relax at one of the restaurants down from the road, and enjoy the stupendous scenery before continuing south on an equally difficult drive, to rejoin the main road at Santiago del Teide.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt-A little farther south, turn off towards Puerto de Santiago, then walk out to the edge of the marina jetty to get the best view of the enormous sheer cliffs, up to 800 m (2,625 ft) high, known appropriately as Los Gigantes (The Giants).

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:This is really of little interest, and the roads often leave something to be desired. However, a trip up the eastern coast from Santa Cruz to just south of Barlovento isn’t too long, and the rather serpentine road runs through some pretty scenery. Make the first stop the miradores of Bartolomé and La Montaña, with the latter being a little higher and affording beautiful vistas along the coast in both directions. Head next for the seaside village of San Andrés and its natural swimming pools at Charco Azul (blue pool). A little inland from San Andrés and Sauces is the Bosque de Los Tilos, the largest wooded area in the whole Canary Islands and designated a “Biosphere Reserve” under the protection of UNESCO. Heritage of Mankind is the information center above the restaurant (open Monday–Friday 8am–3pm). The final destination though is a lovely, remote site just before Barlovento where, after a tortuously twisting journey down through banana plantations, you will reach the Piscinas Fajana; literally swimming pools built into the rocks and fed by the ocean waters that often crash into them. Showers and toilets are on hand, as is the pleasant La Gaviota (the Seagull), a restaurant/bar, and the views north of the cliffs falling straight into the ocean and being pounded by waves are breathtaking.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt-The goal in the north for most travelers is the Roque de los Muchachos, the highest point in the island at 2,423 m (7,950 ft) above sea level. There are several ways up to it, but always be aware of the weather; what looks fine from sea level takes on a different perspective at nearly 2,438 m (8,000 ft). And, of course, it can change dramatically and quickly, so go prepared clothes-wise, and know that you might not see much but clouds. Besides the views, the other attraction up here is the futuristic Observatoria de Astrofísica, regarded as the most important observatory in the Northern Hemisphere and home to some of the world’s most important telescopes, including the 4-m (165-inch) William Herschel telescope. However, as it is only open to visitors for a few days each summer, most will have to be satisfied with just seeing it from the outside.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt-From Las Palmas you have two options. The most northern route runs through the peaceful valley town of Teror. The old whitewashed houses, often built around graceful patios, boast fine traditional carved balconies. The major landmark here is a typically large Canarian church, the Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pino (Our Lady of the Pine). This commemorates the miraculous discovery in 1481, in the branches of a pine tree, of a sacred effigy. The Blessed Virgin of Teror is also the patron saint of Gran Canaria. Alternatively, take the main road that runs inland from close to the cathedral and heads southwest through the towns of Santa Brígida and Vega de San Mateo, offering panoramic views of the east of the island. Because the climate here is exceptionally mild, many Canarians and foreign residents have built very desirable homes in these hills, with the gardens around their villas often being magnificent. A small diversion along this route is certainly worthwhile. Just a few kilometers out of Las Palmas, follow the signs to Bandama, the road (open 8am–10pm) leads up to the nearby Caldera de Bandama, one of the island’s finest natural features and a spectacular mirador in its own right. This volcanic crater, almost a kilometer (more than a half mile) across, is green, fertile.and drops some 198 m (650 ft) down. A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-golfers are tempted to pick up a club. The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant south.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:From the west of the island drive north from Agaete and then turn inland following the signs to Tejeda for a really pleasant, and not unduly difficult, mountain ascent. The valleys here are wide and their slopes play host to some small farms; it is one of the few places in the islands where you will come across farm animals. Of interest, too, are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped Mount Teide floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of Gran Canaria itself. Before reaching Tejeda turn off to the village of Artenara, to the southwest, and what is undoubtedly the best restaurant view on the island. The place in question is Méson de la Silla, not easy to spot, parallel to the main road. A dark tunnel leads through the rock with no hint of what is to come, then emerges on the other side of the mountain to a bright 180-degree mountain panorama. To the left the head of the valley, green and dotted with whitewashed little villages; it leads up to Tejeda itself, but the more dramatic vistas are directly in front and to the right. Here, the scenario is dramatic indeed; jagged peaks fill the horizon and many smaller ones are spread throughout the valley giving the impression of looking down on a minor mountain range.

The Southern Heng Mountain (Hengshannan, also called Nanyue), one of China’s Five Sacred Mountains in the ancient Daoist pantheon, is 112 km (70 miles) south of Changsha. Its temples, monasteries, and misty vistas are well worth a day’s hike. Wulingyuan, a large nature preserve better known to the Chinese as Zhangjiajie, is 350 km (217 miles) west of Changsha. Known as “China’s Yellowstone,” this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a remote park of spectacular and uncanny quartz labyrinths and pinnacles, massive limestone caves, white-water rapids, steep hiking trails, and minority villages.

Erhai Lake is a 30-minute walk from town, and its main village, Caicun, is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses. Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages, including the temple dedicated to Guanyin (goddess of mercy) on Putuo Island. Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages, including the market at Wase. One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping, 30 minutes up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from Dali. It’s a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt:The chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas (Santasi), founded in 825. The tallest of the three towers, all sealed up, rises to 16 tiers. The complex is ringed by hundreds of stalls, many of them selling specimens of the local marble. There are also temples and pagodas in the steep foothills of the Cangshan (Green Mountain) range. Although seldom open, they provide the perfect ornaments for a day’s hike from vista to vista over this long, narrow valley that reaches west to Tibet.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt:For a full panorama of West Lake and the city, go up to the viewing platforms at a pavilion atop Wu Hill (Wushan), south of the lake. The hilltop is richly forested with gingko, maple, and camphor trees. Another vista spot is located on the summit of the hill on the north side of the lake, where the hauntingly beautiful Baochu Pagoda stands. But the beauty of the lake can best be appreciated at close range: from the deck of a sightseeing boat or from the paths and causeways along its shore. The lake edge is abundantly supplied with flowers, trees, and (unusual in China) secluded places where lovers can find privacy.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt-The highlight of a boat trip across West Lake is the largest of three man-made islands, a “small fairy island” known as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon (Santan Yinyue). The island, created in the Ming Dynasty, was ingeniously provided with an island of its own, in the center of its own lake. A zigzag bridge will get you there. Three small stone pagodas, rebuilt in the 17th century, rise from the main lake just south of the isle. On the night of the Moon Festival, candles are placed inside the pagodas. The flickering light emanating from the small round windows gives the lake 15 reflections imitating the real moon.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhereToGo.txt:There are only two major sights. Abd-er-Rahman III’s massive Alcazaba looms large on the hilltop above the city. Although an earthquake caused extensive damage in 1522, the crenellated ocher outer walls and a section of the turreted ramparts stand firm, providing wide-ranging vistas over the city and the sea. And the forbidding, fortified cathedral that stands just inland from the waterfront Paseo de Almería was built during the 16th century, when Barbary pirates were terrorizing the coast (see page 18).
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhereToGo.txt-Inland from Almería lies one of the most un-European landscapes on the European continent. The Sierra de Alhamilla is a desert of barren mountains, rocky ravines, and dry gravel riverbeds; spiky agave plants and prickly pears are the only vegetation. The region’s uncanny resemblance to the American West made it a popular film location for spaghetti westerns, including such classics as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which set a young Clint Eastwood on the road to stardom in Hollywood. Near the village of Tabernas is an area known as Mini-Hollywood, where two spaghetti-western film sets have been preserved as tourist attractions, complete with horses, cowboys, and barroom brawls.

Although it has been a Christian bastion since the third century, it was a pagan sacrificial site long before that. Continue uphill to the fortress, which is, in fact, two castles. Ramparts connect the smaller pre-Roman Castillo Menor (Small Castle) with the Roman and post-Roman Castillo Mayor (Main Castle), once notorious for its dungeon. Disgraced princes and other noblemen were confined here, their only solace being the ruined 15th-century chapel adjacent.

Breakfast might be a bowl of porridge or toast and eggs. After a bit of a wash-up from a basin of warm water, you’ll be on the trail by 7am. No need to worry about packing up the tent or cleaning the breakfast dishes: that’s what you’ve hired the porters to do.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhatToDo.txt:Porters stop for their first real meal of the day — rice and lentils — between 10 and 11am, and consequently, trekkers can also expect to eat lunch fairly early, usually on the edge of a village or at a scenic vista. After a bit of exploration in the area, there will be a few more hours of hiking before calling it quits for the day around 3pm, once again usually in an interesting village. The porters will then busy themselves with setting up camp, usually in a designated campground, and preparing the evening meal. The sun often goes behind the mountains early, and supper always follows soon after sunset, usually around 6pm. With only kerosene lamps to keep away the dark, exhausted trekkers usually head for bed by 9pm.
